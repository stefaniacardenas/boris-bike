# Boris bike
============

Overview
---------

This is my third week project at [Makers Academy] (http://www.makersacademy.com/â€Ž).

The goal of the exercise is to create a simple system for managing Boris bikes in London.
The system will keep track of a number of docking stations and the bikes.
It will allow you to rent the bikes and return them. Occasionally the bikes will break and then they will be unavailable for rental. 
There will also be a garage to fix the bikes and a van to move the bikes between the stations and the garage.
